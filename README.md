## Covid website ##
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally, there is also a shop where they can buy items such as hand sanitiser and masks to further protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in the country that they are planning to travel to.
