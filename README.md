## Covid website ##
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally,If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in that country that they are planning to travel to. this will help them make the decision weather to go to that country. There would also be global news on the Covid situation of the world.

## Design Process ##
 Markup : 1. As a user who plans to travel overseas or travels overseas frequently, I would like a website where I  can conveniently check the number of Covid-19 cases for the country that I am travelling to so that I know how good or bad the Covid situation is in that country. This will let me know if the condition of Covid in that country is bad or good and decide if i should still continue my trip.
          2. As a user who wants to learn more about Covid-19 and how to protect myself from the virus, I would like a website where I can enjoy learning about Covid-19 such as through quizzes instead of reading off huge chunks of information from websites or watching Youtube videos as it can get quite dry and boring. It would also be better if I earn points or something similar which can be used for something useful so that it motivates me to learn the information properly to answer more questions correctly.
