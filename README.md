# FED Assignment 2 (Melson and Zheng Bin) #
## Covid website ##
We have created a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally, if they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in that country that they are planning to travel to. This will help them make the decision whether to go to that country. There would also be global news on the Covid situation of the world.

## Design Process ##
* As a user who plans to travel overseas, I would like a website where I can conveniently check the number of Covid-19 cases for the country that I am travelling to so as to know the covid situation in that country. Based on the covid cases in the country I am travelling to, I am able to evalulate my choice of whether to travel or to cancel my trip.

* As a user who wants to learn more about Covid 19 and how to protect myself from the virus, I would like a website where I can easily access the information as well as to be able to navigate around the website seamlessly.

* As a user who wants to keep updated of the latest global news, I would like a website which collate news from all around the world so that I am able to access these news easily.

* As a user who values both education and entertainment, I would like a website which have a game to not only engage the users, but also raise awareness in them regarding Covid 19

* As a user who are concerned about their risk of getting covid, I would like a website equipped with a self testing tool to know the possibilty of the covid status, whether is it positive or negative.
