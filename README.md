## Covid website ##
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally,If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in that country that they are planning to travel to. this will help them make the decision weather to go to that country. There would also be global news on the Covid situation of the world.
